        <h2>A tiny scripting language so simple, it's peaceful üôè</h2>
        <p>Hymn is easy to learn. <a href="play.html">Try it online</a>!</p>

        <h3>Small</h3>
        <p>
          Hymn is written in portable C11 code that passes with `-Wall` `-Wextra` `-Werror` `-pedantic` flags. It uses zero external dependencies. Both Make and CMake builds for
          GCC and Windows MSVC are available.
        </p>
        <p>Hymn uses less than 6,000 lines of C code. The JavaScript implementation uses less than 5,000 lines.</p>
        <h3>Simple</h3>
        <p>Hymn has no classes, closures, or namespaces. Tables and arrays are the building blocks for all complex algorithms and data structures.</p>
        <p>Hymn emphasizes one way to do things right. Most programming languages evolve over time, adding significant changes and new syntax. Hymn will not.</p>
        <p>Hymn uses reference counting for memory management. This means scripts keep a smaller footprint, and release memory deterministically.</p>
        <p>
          Hymn natively supports both 64 bit signed integers, and 64 bit floats. Many scripting languages only support a single number type. Hymn stores integers and real numbers
          as distinct types.
